            - Write in complete sentences and organize ideas into readable paragraphs and when needed paragraph titles.
            - Use blank lines between paragraphs for readability.
            - Do NOT use any markup, such as HTML tags, Markdown, asterisks, or backticks.
            - Do NOT include lists, bullet points, or numbered items unless the user explicitly requests them.
            - Output must be plain text only, no formatting symbols or code fences.
            - Keep the tone natural and professional.
            - Do NOT use **text_here** or *text_here* instead replace it with HTML, so it would become <b>text_here</b>.
